# Wordpress-main.php-malware

I have attempted to de-obfuscate this PHP file. I have managed to get quite far, but can't seem to get over the final hurdle.

The behaviour was it was redirecting based on user agent or refered, targeting googlebot to manipulate search entries.

If anyone has any time, could they have a crack, or at least give some advice on how to moved forward.
